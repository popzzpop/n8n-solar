# N8N Solar - Automation Workflow Platform

A complete n8n automation platform deployed on Railway with Supabase database integration.

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates a fully functional n8n workflow automation platform with the following components:

- **n8n Instance**: Self-hosted on Railway with API access enabled
- **Supabase Integration**: Connected PostgreSQL database with REST API
- **Webhook Endpoints**: Ready-to-use triggers for external integrations
- **Workflow Examples**: Pre-configured automation templates

## 📋 Features

### ✅ Completed Setup
- [x] n8n deployed on Railway cloud platform
- [x] Environment variables configured for production
- [x] API access enabled with authentication
- [x] Supabase database integration ready
- [x] First workflow created and tested
- [x] Webhook endpoints configured

### 🛠 Technical Stack
- **Platform**: Railway (https://railway.app)
- **Automation**: n8n (https://n8n.io)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **API**: RESTful webhooks and HTTP endpoints
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens for secure access

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Railway account (https://railway.app)
- Supabase account (https://supabase.com)
- Basic knowledge of workflow automation

### Quick Start

1. **Access the n8n Interface**
   - Open your deployed n8n URL
   - Create your admin account
   - Generate API keys for programmatic access

2. **Configure Supabase Connection**
   - Add Supabase credentials in n8n
   - Test the database connection
   - Create your first data tables

3. **Create Your First Workflow**
   - Use the webhook trigger node
   - Add Supabase data operations
   - Test with sample data

## 📝 Workflow Examples

### Basic Webhook to Database
A simple workflow that:
1. Receives webhook POST requests
2. Validates incoming data
3. Stores data in Supabase tables
4. Returns success response

### Data Processing Pipeline
Advanced workflow featuring:
1. Multiple data sources
2. Data transformation and validation
3. Conditional logic and routing
4. Error handling and notifications

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Key configuration settings:
- `N8N_HOST`: Server binding address
- `N8N_PORT`: Application port (5678)
- `N8N_PROTOCOL`: HTTPS for production
- `N8N_API_ENABLED`: API access control
- `WEBHOOK_URL`: Public webhook endpoint

### Database Setup
Supabase configuration:
- Project URL and API keys
- Database connection strings
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- API authentication methods

## 🔒 Security

### Best Practices Implemented
- API keys stored securely
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- HTTPS encryption enabled
- Database access controls
- Webhook authentication

### Important Security Notes
- Never commit API keys or passwords
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper access controls
- Monitor webhook endpoints for abuse
- Regular security updates

## 📊 Monitoring and Logs

### Available Monitoring
- Railway deployment logs
- n8n execution history
- Workflow performance metrics
- Error tracking and alerts

### Debugging
- Check Railway logs for deployment issues
- Use n8n's built-in execution viewer
- Monitor Supabase query performance
- Test webhooks with curl or Postman
